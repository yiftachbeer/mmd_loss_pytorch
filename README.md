# MMD Loss in PyTorch
An implementation of Maximum Mean Discrepancies (MMD) as a differentiable loss in PyTorch, heavily based on [ZongxianLee's popular repository](https://github.com/ZongxianLee/MMD_Loss.Pytorch).
Same functionality but fixed the minor bugs (indentation, missing self) and simplified the code.

Enjoy!
